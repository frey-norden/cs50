# This is CS50x Intro to Computer Science -- Harvard University edX

This is my repo of code for the course. It is an exciting opportunity to study this subject, and I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge in the field of computer science, computation, and the art of programming. I know I am among great company in this course. So, now on to the task of learning to communicate with the computer (computers^n) using C, Python, SQL and whatever other tools necessary to solve the challenges on this quest.
